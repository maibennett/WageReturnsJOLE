\footnotesize{Notes: Education is highest grade completed by the respondent's biological parents. Family income is in 1,000's of 1982-84\$. All demographic and family variables are measured as of the first survey round in both cohorts except female-headed household, which is from age 14 in NLSY97. The AFQT distribution is normalized so that the distribution including all cohorts is mean-zero, variance one. For median AFQT score, the significance comes from bootstrapped standard errors of the median (500 replications). For standard deviations of AFQT score, the significance comes from two-tailed F-tests of the ratio of the variances. Statistics weighted by NLSY sampling weights. Significance reported at the 1\% (***), 5\% (**), and 10\% (*) levels. Sample size for statistical analysis varied for some variables due to missing values (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:sample} for more on sample creation.)}
